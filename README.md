# MillenniumDB Driver
---
Welcome to the official Python driver for the MillenniumDB! This driver allows you to easily interact with MillenniumDB directly from your Python applications.

For more information about the MillenniumDB server, check out the [MillenniumDB repository](https://github.com/MillenniumDB/MillenniumDB).

## 2. Build instructions

### Setup

Dependencies:

- Git
- MillenniumDB
- Setuptools
- Wheel

### Installation

Install the driver and the dependecies.

```bash
pip install millenniumdb-driver
```

### Usage

After successfully installing the project, you can start using the library in your Python programs.

#### Creating a Driver instance

First you must create a `Driver` instance:

```bash
url = 'URL for the MillenniumDB server'
driver = millenniumdb_driver.driver(url)
```

When you are done with the driver, you should close it before exiting the application.

```bash
driver.close()
```

#### Acquiring a Session

For sending queries to the MillenniumDB server, you must acquire a session instance:

```bash
session = driver.session()
```

Then you can send queries through your session.

```bash
query = 'MATCH (?from)-[:?type]->(?to) RETURN * LIMIT 10'
result = session.run(query)
```

#### Consuming results

The alternatives for consuming results must never be mixed because it would generate undefined behavior on your client and/or server. It is important to mention that the session must be closed when your operations are done.

```bash
result.variables() -> Tuple[str]
```

Returns the list of variables in the result.

```bash
result.records() -> List[Record]
```

Returns the list of `Records` in the result.

```bash
result.values() -> List[object]
```

Returns the list of values in the result.

```bash
result.data() -> List[Dict[str, object]]
```

Returns the list of records in the result as dictionaries.

```bash
result.to_df() -> "DataFrame"
```

Returns the result as a Pandas DataFrame.

```bash
result.summary() -> object
```

Returns the summary of the result.

```bash
for record in result: -> Iterator[Record]
    print(result)
```

Iterates over each record in result.
